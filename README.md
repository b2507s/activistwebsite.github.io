Mental Health Advocacy for Incarcerated Women Activist Website

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make this website. 

The purpose of this website is to educate and spread awareness of the conditions of mental health, the importance of advocating for incarcerated women, and current efforts to improve health resources for women in prison.
